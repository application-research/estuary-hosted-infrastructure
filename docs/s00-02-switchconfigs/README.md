# ðŸš§ Stage 00 - Step 2 - Core switch + BMC switch Configuration ðŸš§
* Plug in the core switch.
* Plug in an out of band serial device to its console port and login.
* Copy switch-serial.cfg.dist to switch-serial.cfg and fill it out with the settings needed to access the serial console. ðŸš§
* Copy switch_settings.cfg.dist to switch_settings.cfg and fill it out with the details of your IP address configurations. ðŸš§
* Run `python3 switches.py --initial` to apply the initial configuration settings (Might end up as Ansible, probably) ðŸš§

At this point your switch installation is completed, but you will need to set up the cabling before you can get WAN and LAN working.
