Rescue covers accessing the infrastructure when All Hope Is Lost, when you need to access things with no other easy way in, or when a physical Groundfloor node is having issues. It covers accessing machines using IPMI (out of band access for when the OS is not responding) and dialing in using Wireguard (for when the Netbird Bastion hosts are unavailable)
